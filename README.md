Provides JavaScript helpers for working with emoji.

(new 2024 branch)

This package requires `\p{Emoji}` support (and friends).
This is available in all browsers from mid-2020, see [Unicode character class escape](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Unicode_character_class_escape).

It additionally can take advantage of [Unicode character sets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/unicodeSets), supported everywhere from September 2023.
